                        <strong>HEY PRACHI, IF YOU EVER OPEN THIS ENVELOPE AGAIN 
I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THIS POEM DOWN HERE IS WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN FOR YOU 
TO TELL EVRYTHING AND THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU</strong>
                        <p>


  <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>                           
                            

I never meant to cause you pain,
But I stumbled and I lost my way.
In the heat of the moment, I let you down,
Now I'm left with regrets and a broken crown.
 <br>
                            <br>   

But I'm here to make it right,
To heal the wounds and ease your plight.
I'm ready to admit my wrongs,
Hoping you'll give our love another song.
 <br>
                            <br>   

Forgive me, Prachi, for the hurt I've caused,
I'm sorry for the tears and the endless pause.
Let's wipe the slate clean, start anew,
I'm begging for a second chance with you.
 <br>
                            <br>   

I never wanted to see you cry,
But my foolishness made the love run dry.
I took your heart for granted, and it slipped away,
Now I'm on my knees, begging you to stay.
 <br>
                            <br>   

I promise to change, to be the man you deserve,
To cherish you always, with every word.
Let's mend the pieces of our broken dreams,
And build a future brighter than it seems.
 <br>
                            <br>   

Forgive me, Prachi, for the hurt I've caused,
I'm sorry for the tears and the endless pause.
Let's wipe the slate clean, start anew,
I'm begging for a second chance with you.
 <br>
                            <br>   

I'll hold your hand through the darkest days,
Wipe your tears and chase your fears away.
Together we can overcome any storm,
With love as our armor, we'll transform.
 <br>
                            <br>   

Forgive me, Prachi, for the hurt I've caused,
I'm sorry for the tears and the endless pause.
Let's wipe the slate clean, start anew,
I'm begging for a second chance with you.
 <br>
                            <br>   

You mean the world to me, you're my guiding light,
I'll do whatever it takes to make things right.
With this poem as my plea, I hope you'll see,
That my love for you is true, for eternity.
