HEY PRACHI, IF YOU EVER OPEN THIS ENVELOPE AGAIN 
I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THIS POEM DOWN HERE IS WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN FOR YOU 
TO TELL EVRYTHING AND THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU
  <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>                           
                            

I never meant to cause you pain,
But I stumbled and I lost my way.
In the heat of the moment, I let you down,
Now I'm left with regrets and a broken crown.


But I'm here to make it right,
To heal the wounds and ease your plight.
I'm ready to admit my wrongs,
Hoping you'll give our love another song.


Forgive me, Prachi, for the hurt I've caused,
I'm sorry for the tears and the endless pause.
Let's wipe the slate clean, start anew,
I'm begging for a second chance with you.


I never wanted to see you cry,
But my foolishness made the love run dry.
I took your heart for granted, and it slipped away,
Now I'm on my knees, begging you to stay.


I promise to change, to be the man you deserve,
To cherish you always, with every word.
Let's mend the pieces of our broken dreams,
And build a future brighter than it seems.


Forgive me, Prachi, for the hurt I've caused,
I'm sorry for the tears and the endless pause.
Let's wipe the slate clean, start anew,
I'm begging for a second chance with you.


I'll hold your hand through the darkest days,
Wipe your tears and chase your fears away.
Together we can overcome any storm,
With love as our armor, we'll transform.


Forgive me, Prachi, for the hurt I've caused,
I'm sorry for the tears and the endless pause.
Let's wipe the slate clean, start anew,
I'm begging for a second chance with you.


You mean the world to me, you're my guiding light,
I'll do whatever it takes to make things right.
With this poem as my plea, I hope you'll see,
That my love for you is true, for eternity.
